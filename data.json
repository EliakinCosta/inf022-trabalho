Added oversampling/antialising to createThumbnailDevice. Interpolation is done using KisTransformWorker with bilinear interpolation. Added parameter that controls oversampling ratio.\n2. Added benchmark for new thumbnail code. Results for 6Kx8K image turned into 640px thumbnail see below. About 2x hit in time for 2x oversampling. Quality with 2x oversampling is much better than no oversampling. 4x oversampling slightly better, but not dramatically. See below.\n3. Changed oversampling for overview widget to 2x.\n4. Fixed caching of oversampled thumbnails.\n5.

This is an abstract interface to let the spinboxes use different sorts of units from KoUnit, but also document relative lenght units (vw, vh), angle units and time units.\n\nThis force some little tricks in the design, since the spinboxes must stay in the widget library, but a lot of needed info for relative units can't be acessed from this library.\n\nSo the idea is to subclass the KisSpinBoxUnitManager where it can acess thoses datas, then send a pointer to the spinboxes. With polymorphism we can make all of this work.\n\nSo now it's possible to change the unit by writing the symbol of this unit at the end of a KisDoubleParseUnitSpinBox.\n\nThere's a few problem left, for example in some places the spinbox is destroyed and rebuilt everytime the user want to use it, so the active unit is not kept.\n\nThere's also a few refactoring needed in a lot of places that use simple parse spinboxes with a suffix rather than unit spinbox.\n\nTest Plan:\nActivate all Karbon tool in your kritarc (not needed, But I've checked it works with them too).\n\nLaunch krita\n\nCreate a new document\n\nCreate a new vector layer (the unit spinbox is used essentially for Karbon tools for the moment).\n\nYou can try the freehand path and draw path karbon tool, set a size in any unit you want and start to draw.\n\nThen you can use the default tool (moving, resizing objects, setting a shadow). In all thoses steps you can use units like mm, cm, pt, ... but also px, vw, vh).\n\nFinally open the add shape and shape propeties docker. Add a few shapes and try to change the properties. deselect the shape reselect if, you'll found that the unit is reset to px (the spin box has been destroyed, then recreated).\n(I had a lots of problem with this docker, it needs a few refactoring to work with the new spinboxes).\n\nClose krita and check there's not segfault caused by the patch (I had this problem a few time, and had to find way to prevent it).\n\nReviewers: #krita, dkazakov\n\nSubscribers: rempt\n\nDifferential Revision: https://phabricator.kde.org/D2771"}}, {"color": "FFFF0000", "data": {"message": "Create a static class with a builder to Let The KisDoubleParseUnitSpinBox build it's own unit manager possibly with a class from a library not linked to widget.\n\nThis allow to have all UnitSpinBoxes uses the DocumentAware manager without traking and setting it everywhere in the code."}}, {"color": "FFFF0000", "data": {"message": "Merge branch 'master' of git://anongit.kde.org/krita into jospin/unit_spin_boxes"}}, {"color": "FFFF0000", "data": {"message": "Suppress the use of KoStrokeConfig widget in a few krita tool.\n\nThis widget is useless when painting on a raster layer, and on a vector layer the stroke can be configured using the default tool.\n\nFor karbon tools it's harder.

It also changes properly using the lut manager exposure controls, and it\u2019s main element, the visual color selector can use the advanced color selector config.\n\nThis selector is also intergrated into a kis_color_button and used where ever I could port it reliably. It\u2019ll also show up in the pop-up palette.\n\nFurthermore, this merge contains little palette usability things, like being able to see the swatch name, search by swatch name and have the split->layer functionality use a palette to name the resultant layers. Also allows custom-pattern to be mindful of the active selection.\n\nAnyway, needs a lot of testing!\n\nCCMAIL:kimageshop@kde.org\nRef T2337\nRef T2438\n\nSquashed commit of the following:\n\ncommit 1cf8527877d316b0c3149494535740b7ff3e5c6f\nAuthor: Wolthera van Hovell tot Westerflier <griffinvalley@gmail.com>\nDate:   Tue Sep 6 16:16:24 2016 +0200\n\n    Fix build\n\ncommit d39cecc36ab9fa2f32de8fa3cefe7072c1824dcf\nAuthor: Wolthera van Hovell tot Westerflier <griffinvalley@gmail.com>\nDate:   Tue Sep 6 15:32:08 2016 +0200\n\n    Rename the internal color selector dialog to reflect it being a dialog\n\ncommit afc8658b4114df00644061105b4ed56f08cc257b\nMerge: 27d4034 91bdcfe\nAuthor: Wolthera van Hovell tot Westerflier <griffinvalley@gmail.com>\nDate:   Tue Sep 6 15:22:33 2016 +0200\n\n    Merge branch 'master' into krita-testing-wolthera\n\ncommit 27d4034efe5d37cde00bb3dd33cab985f6deacd2\nAuthor: Wolthera van Hovell tot Westerflier <griffinvalley@gmail.com>\nDate:   Sat Sep 3 16:35:23 2016 +0200\n\n    Fix screencolor picker label.\n\n    Ref T2438\n\ncommit 29d34d885455f1e5fbfd3ba0e1c5c92974d4f2bf\nAuthor: Wolthera van Hovell tot Westerflier <griffinvalley@gmail.com>\nDate:   Sat Sep 3 16:20:07 2016 +0200\n\n    Fix color conversion issues with the selector.\n\n    Now the selector will show grayscale on a mask, and will update upon changing the image color space.\n\n    Ref T2438\n\ncommit 3dc397583dbb93b4a362abce1ad6df50ee2c7485\nAuthor: Wolthera van Hovell tot Westerflier <griffinvalley@gmail.com>\nDate:   Fri Sep 2 17:47:53 2016 +0200\n\n    Simplify Gradient Map filter and make it usable as a filter layer.\n\n    There's some awkwardness with the first two generic gradients as the color isn't stored, but this is good for now.\n\n    Fixes T1837\n\ncommit 4a4f704e1700a24f214a844879df09128df64b95\nAuthor: Boudewijn Rempt <boud@valdyas.org>\nDate:   Fri Sep 2 17:34:00 2016 +0200\n\n    Fix drawing the gradient\n\ncommit 13f83919be65000fc1682940afe6c81fdcc8c1ae\nAuthor: Julian Thijssen <Nimthora@gmail.com>\nDate:   Fri Sep 2 17:30:51 2016 +0200\n\n    Nearest neighbour filtering applies on all zoom levels\n\ncommit 0a4a62bc9370878441d57f87ed50fbbc7d394ef7\nAuthor: Boudewijn Rempt <boud@valdyas.org>\nDate:   Fri Sep 2 16:36:02 2016 +0200\n\n    Refactor KisColorSource to use KoColor in a saner way\n\ncommit 58bf4b9ab601c6f5f0aa593c5e86c20ee994e545\nAuthor: Boudewijn Rempt <boud@valdyas.org>\nDate:   Fri Sep 2 16:21:40 2016 +0200\n\n    Make KoSegmentGradient::colorAt threadsafe\n\ncommit 54df09f834a5fa36db6b98742f7ac05ec9b90170\nAuthor: Boudewijn Rempt <boud@valdyas.org>\nDate:   Fri Sep 2 16:21:19 2016 +0200\n\n    Make this class safe\n\n    It means we don't cache the QImage, but there is no alternative\n\ncommit 362c78b89d997845e0fdd7764dd896d031ac632c\nAuthor: Boudewijn Rempt <boud@valdyas.org>\nDate:   Fri Sep 2 16:21:02 2016 +0200\n\n    Warn that this class is not threadsafe\n\ncommit cd02553f552f01cd73c2ec57874195f82d4110f3\nAuthor: Boudewijn Rempt <boud@valdyas.org>\nDate:   Fri Sep 2 16:06:51 2016 +0200\n\n    Make KoStopGradient::colorAt threadsave\n\n    Sneakily, the \"buffer\" variable was made a class variable.

It would also give a clear support target (instead of GLES2 + extensions), make many checks obsolete and in this case also circumvent a bug by just getting an offset table to the desired function subset. I think to remember than QPainter depends on deprecated GL functions and that's why 3.2core can't be set by default but Nimmy's opengl branch he already uses GL3.2Core (Core probably for compatiblity with OSX) like commit dd32d5e421a4a357e268bd2dbb8b679b6ddd2699\nSo, according to KisOpenGL::setDefaultFormat 3.0 is fine and once the way is free for 3.2 we can bump it up.\n\nTest Plan:\n* Krita built with patch applied on Linux/Windows\n* Open an image and see if the brush outline is XOR'd accordingly\n\nReviewers: Nim, dkazakov\n\nReviewed By: Nim, dkazakov\n\nSubscribers: dkazakov\n\nDifferential Revision: https://phabricator.kde.org/D4506"}}]}]}, {"angle": 0.066, "label": "Raphael Cojocaru", "windows": [{"position": 10, "molecules": [{"color": "FFFF0000", "data": {"message": "Solved the \"Title of document tab/subwindow is not updated after changing document title\" bug\n\nSummary: The issue was that when the current document title\nwas changed (by using Document Information dialog for example),\nits name shown in the files tab remained the same, without\nbeing updated.
